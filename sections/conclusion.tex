The annotation task design experiment showed that the highest data quality is achieved by a task phrased as a \textit{slow, diverging and spatially proximate} similarity comparison with an intermediary classification equal to its reference.

Participant feedback in response to testing the task designs, showed that tasks should be phrased in a way that reflects the annotator's perception, empowering annotators to provide the most accurate and representative classifications.
