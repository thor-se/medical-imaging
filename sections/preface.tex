{\textbf{\textit{Abstract--}Crowdsourcing in medical image analysis widens the pool of available annotators, but also raises the question of how to best design annotation tasks. This project samples an existing annotation task design, and varies it across the scale of interaction attributes. Using an image dataset sourced from the ISIC 2017 Challenge \cite{ISIC2017Challenge}, this project explores the impact of design choices on the quality of data. Quality is assessed through comparison to the ISIC ground truth. The findings suggest that similarity tasks produce the highest quality of results.}} \\
